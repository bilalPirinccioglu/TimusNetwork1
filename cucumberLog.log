carefully as it applies to you. This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected by or on behalf of Timus in
connection with the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of the Website;</li>
<li>Procurement and use of the Services;</li>
<li>Use of the Management Portal; and</li>
<li>Use of Timus Connect.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please note that certain information may be collected from Customers by Partners on behalf of Timus, such as
information provided when a Customer purchases or registers for Services, and this Privacy Policy only covers the
practices of Timus with respect to such information. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of Partners or
any other third parties, nor does it cover information collected by Partners for purposes other than on behalf of
Timus in connection with the Services. For example, if a Partner provides its own services to Customers (such as
technical support or other professional services), the exchange of information in connection with such services is
not subject to this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<b>Information we collect:</b> We collect several types of information from and about Website Visitors, Customers,
Partners, and End Users, including the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Personal information, which is data that reasonably can be used to identify or describe an individual, such as
your name, business affiliation, postal address, telephone number, or email address. We collect personal
information only when you voluntarily provide it to us. You do not need to provide personal information to
simply browse the Website. You will need to provide personal information to access and use the Services, and you
have the right to request that we delete your personal information. The personal information we collect (if you
provide it to us) may include, but is not limited to:

<li>your home, billing, or other physical address (including street name, city/town, state/province, postal
code);</li>
<li>your email address;</li>
<li>your telephone number;</li>
<li>your financial information, including credit card or bank account information; and</li>
<li>any other identifier that permits Timus to make physical or online contact with you.</li>
</ul>
<li>
Information that is about you but individually does not identify you.
</li>
<li>
Information about your internet connection, usage details, and the equipment you use to access the Website or
Services or any component thereof.
</li>

<p>
<b>How we Collect Your Information:</b> Timus collects your information directly from you when you provide it to us,
as
described below in this section of the Privacy Policy. We may also collect certain information automatically as you
use the Website or Services. Please review the section further below in this Privacy Policy titled “Cookies and
Tracking Technologies” for more information on our automatic collection practices.
</p>
<p>
We may collect information, including personal information, directly from you when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>you submit a Contact Form;</li>
<li>you use the Services;</li>
<li>you create an account to access the Management Portal or Timus Connect;</li>
<li>you subscribe to receive emails or newsletters from Timus;</li>
<li>you request a demonstration of the Services; </li>
<li>you participate in surveys and evaluations; </li>
<li>you request information or materials;</li>

</ul>
<p>
We also may collect your information from Partners if you provide information to them in connection with procuring
or using Services.
</p>
<p>
<b>How We Use Your Information:</b> Timus collects and uses your information, including your personal information,
to
operate and improve the Website, Management Platform, and Timus Connect, and to deliver the services or carry out
the transactions you have requested. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service;
making the Website, Management Platform, and Timus Connect easier to use by eliminating the need for you to
repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services,
and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.
</p>
<p>
We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications
such as welcome letters, information updates, billing information, information on technical service issues, and
security announcements. We may also contact you to inform you of other products or services available from Timus and
its Affiliates.
</p>
<p>
Personal information collected on the Website and through the Services may be stored and processed in the United
States or any other country in which Timus or its Affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by
using the Website or Services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
</p>
<p>
<b>Sharing of Information:</b> Timus will not sell, rent, or lease your information, including your personal
information,
to others. Timus shares personal information with its Affiliates and other companies working on our behalf. Except
as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own
marketing purposes unless you have provided consent.
</p>
<p>
Timus may share your information, including personal information, with its Affiliates. The information submitted
through Contact Forms may be stored and processed by Affiliates in the United States or any other country in which
the Affiliates maintain facilities, and by submitting a Contact Form, you consent to any such transfer of
information outside of your country.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, we use third parties to collect, use, analyze, and otherwise process information, including personal
information, on our behalf. This includes our use of certain products and services provided by third parties for the
purposes of enabling certain features on the Website, Management Portal, and Timus Connect. For example, if you
submit a Contact Form or otherwise provide information to us through the Website, the information you submit may be
processed by third-party providers that we use to enable Contact Forms and other interactions on the Website. We
occasionally hire other third parties to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and
delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing
statistical analysis of our services. For example, we may use a third-party payment processer to facilitate
purchases of subscriptions to use the Services. Service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal
information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information
and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
</p>
<p>
If you request something from the Website or through the Services (for example, a product or service, a callback, or
specific marketing materials), we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request or inquiry. To help
us do this, we may share information with our providers or Partners.
</p>
<p>
We may access or disclose your information, including your personal information, if we believe such action is
necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on Timus; (b) protect and defend the rights or
property of Timus (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the
personal safety of our customers or members of the public.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cookies and Tracking Technologies:</b> When you use the Website or Services, we may use automatic data collection
technologies to collect certain information about you and your device. The type of information we may automatically
collect when you use the Website or Services includes:
</p>
<ul>

Services, including traffic data, logs, browsing actions and patterns, and your activities and interactions on
the Website, Management Platform, and Timus Connect.</li>
<li><i>Device Information.</i> We may collect information about your device and internet connection, including the
device’s unique identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, mobile network information, and
telephone number.</li>
<li><i>Location Information.</i> When you use Timus Connect, we may also collect real-time information about the
location
of your device.</li>

</ul>
<p>
If you do not want us to automatically collect these types of information, do not use the Website or Services and do
not download Timus Connect.
</p>
<p>
The technologies we use for automatic information collection include cookies (whether browser cookies or mobile
cookies). A cookie is a small file placed on your device. Cookies are commonly used to track internet activity and
provide an enhanced experience when using the internet. Timus may use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable
information. We use cookies to help us better understand Website usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas
of the Website users prefer. Third party vendors, including Google, may use cookies to serve ads to you while you
are using the Website or Services based on your prior visits. It may be possible to refuse to accept cookies by
activating the appropriate setting on your browser or smartphone. However, if you select this setting, you may be
unable to access certain parts or features of the Website or Services.
</p>
<p>
In addition to cookies, we may use additional tracking technologies in connection with your use of the Services.
These include technologies that track your activities on the Management Platform and Timus Connect and additional
information about your device such as its configuration settings and patterns of usage among multiple devices. We
use these technologies to collect information that is relevant to the nature of the Services, and we do not sell or
share the information collected through these technologies with any third parties.
</p>
<p>
<b>Your Choices:</b> Timus provides a number of ways for you to “opt-out” of receiving additional information from
us, or
having us provide your personal information to our partners. We may offer you these choices at the time you give us
your personal information.
</p>
<p>
If you do not wish to continue receiving certain marketing materials (e.g., email messages), you can opt-out of
receiving these materials by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the materials. This option does not
apply to communications primarily for the purpose of administering orders, contracts, support, product safety
warnings, software updates, or other administrative and transactional notices.

<p>
<b>Safeguarding your information:</b> In order to protect your information, including your personal information,
from
improper disclosure, Timus uses commercially reasonable efforts to maintain a secure operating environment to
protect any information we collect. We use the most accurate and current information you provide in order to process
your request. Once received, we limit access of your information to only those employees with a legitimate business
need to review them. Furthermore, whenever you transmit personal information, such as credit card information, to us
through our website, we provide you access to a third-party server that allows encryption across the internet.
Browsers offer varying degrees of security, particularly in regard to encryption. Even the same version of a browser
can come with different levels of encryption. See your browser’s settings or documentation for more information.
Finally, we take care to dispose of your information properly so that third parties will not be able to access it.
This includes destroying, erasing, or making unreadable the information. While we are committed to protecting your
privacy, please be aware that no transaction over the internet can be completely secure.
</p>
<p>
<b>Enforcement:</b> Timus regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any
questions or concerns regarding this statement or our treatment of personal information by contacting us at the link

</p>
<p>
<b>Links to Other Websites:</b> The Website and Services may provide links to third-party websites, such as those of
our
business partners, payment processors, and online advertisers. You should review their privacy policies to learn

<b><u>SPECIFIC PROVISIONS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS:</u></b> This section of the Privacy Policy applies only to
individuals who
reside in California. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended and supplemented by the California
Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively the “CCPA”) provides additional rights to know, delete and opt out, and
requires businesses collecting or disclosing Personal Information to provide notices and means to exercise rights.
For Purposes of this section, “Personal Information” has the definition set forth in the CCPA.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>California Notice of Collection:</i></b> We or our service providers have collected the following categories
of information
enumerated in the CCPA in connection with the Websiteand Services:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Any other information you have chosen to provide to us through the Website, Management Portal, or Timus
Connect.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We do not generally sell information as the term “sell” is traditionally understood. However, to the extent “sale”
under the CCPA would be interpreted to include any of the activities described in the “Sharing of information”
section above, we will comply with applicable law as to such activity.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Right to Know and Delete:</i></b> If you are a California resident, you have the right to delete Personal

<li>Specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To exercise any of these rights, please submit a request to us at <a href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;68040d0f0904281c01051d1b060d1c1f071a031b460b0705&quot;>[email&amp;#160;protected]</a>. In the request, please
specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the request. We will confirm receipt of your
request within ten (10) days. We may require specific information from you to help us verify your identity and
process your request. Please note that, in many instances, we do not collect types of information that enable us to
identify you. As such, if we do not have information that permits us to verify your identity, we may deny your
requests to know or delete. A request for access can be made by you only twice within a twelve (12) month period.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Right to Opt Out:</i></b> Under the CCPA, you have the right to opt out of the sale of your Personal
Information to third
parties at any time. Timus does not “sell” your Personal Information as it is currently defined under the CCPA. You

<b><u>NOTICE TO INTERNATIONAL RESIDENTS:</u></b> Timus is headquartered in the United States. The Website,
Management Portal, and
Timus Connect are primarily operated and managed on servers located and operated within the United States. In order
to use the Website or Services, you may be sending your personal information outside of the country where you reside
or are located, including to the United States. Accordingly, if you reside or are located outside of the United
States, your personal information may be transferred outside of the country where you reside or are located,
including to countries that may not or do not provide the same level of protection for your personal information. We
are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information when it is transferred.
</p>
<p>
<b><u>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR USERS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AND UNITED KINGDOM:</u></b> Timus is
established in the
United States and has operations and service providers in the United States and throughout the world. As such, we
and our service providers may transfer your personal information to, or access it in, jurisdictions that may not
provide levels of data protection equivalent to those in your country of residence. By using the Website or
Services, or otherwise interacting with us, regardless of where you live or where you provide information to us, you
consent to our use and our service providers’ use of your personal information worldwide and to the transfer of your
personal information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States. In certain
circumstances, courts, regulatory agencies, law enforcement agencies, or security authorities in those other
countries may be entitled to access your personal information.
</p>
<p>
Timus is aware of the July 16, 2020 ruling by the European Court of Justice invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield
Framework. Accordingly, we will take adequate measures designed to protect the transfer of Personal Information of
individuals in the European Economic Area (EU Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (“<b>EEA</b>”), such
as
relying on the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (“<b>EU SCCs</b>”) as a legal mechanism for
such
transfer, or other adequate transfer mechanism as required under relevant data protection laws, as well as
additional safeguards, where appropriate. A copy of these clauses may be obtained by contacting us at the email
address listed below.
</p>
<p>
For transfers to or from the United Kingdom (“<b>UK</b>”), we make use of the EU SCCs, as modified by the UK’s
International Data Transfer Addendum (collectively the “<b>UK SCCs</b>”). For individuals located in the EEA or the
UK, the
term “personal information,” as used in this section, is equivalent to “personal data” under applicable European and
UK data protection legislation.
</p>
<p>
If you are located in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, you have certain rights and protections under applicable law
regarding the processing of your personal information, as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation
(“<b>GDPR</b>”), and this section applies to you.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Legal Basis for Processing:</i></b> When we process your personal information, we will do so in reliance on
the following
lawful bases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., providing the services you requested).</li>
<li>When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal information to operate our business or protect
our interests (e.g., to provide, maintain, and improve our services, conduct data analytics, and communicate
with you).</li>
<li>To comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to maintain a record of your consents and track those who have
opted out of non-administrative communications).</li>
<li>When we have your consent to do so (e.g., when you opt in to receive non-administrative communications from
us). When consent is the legal basis for our processing your personal information, you may withdraw such consent
at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><i>Data Retention:</i></b> We store personal information associated with your account for as long as your account
remains
active. If you close your account, we will delete your account data within thirty (30) days, unless reasonably
necessary to comply with our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations. We store other data for as long as
necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally collected it and for other legitimate business purposes,
including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Your Rights:</i></b> For users in the European Union, according to the GDPR, you have the following statutory
rights:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Information.</b> At the point where personal information is collected from the data subject, as defined by
the GDPR,
or obtained from another source, there is a requirement to inform the data subject about our use of that
personal
information and the rights of data subjects over it. Compliance with this right is provided within this Privacy
Policy.</li>
<li><b>Access.</b> You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal information concerning
you is
being processed, and, where that is the case, all necessary information to make the process transparent. You
also
have the right to obtain a copy of your personal information being processed.</li>
<li><b>Rectification.</b> You have the right to require rectification of inaccurate data about you.</li>
<li><b>Erasure.</b> You have the right to ask for the deletion of your data in certain circumstances.</li>
<li><b>Restrict processing.</b> You have the right to restrict processing of data under certain specified
circumstances.
</li>
<li><b>Data portability.</b> You have the right to request for the receipt or the transfer to another organization,
in a
machine-readable form, of your personal information.</li>
<li><b>Object to processing.</b> You have the right to ask us to stop using all or some of your personal information
under
certain specified circumstances.</li>
<li><b>Right to withdraw consent.</b> When you have given your explicit consent for the processing of your data, you
can
withdraw it at any time without justification. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of
processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If would like to exercise your rights, please let us know by sending an email at <a href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;8ae6efedebe6cafee3e7fff9e4effefde5f8e1f9a4e9e5e7&quot;>[email&amp;#160;protected]</a>.
</p>
<p>
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority or to the Data Protection
Authority where the alleged infringement took place.

<p>
<b>How We Use Your Information:</b> Timus collects and uses your information, including your personal information,
to
operate and improve the Website, Management Platform, and Timus Connect, and to deliver the services or carry out
the transactions you have requested. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service;
making the Website, Management Platform, and Timus Connect easier to use by eliminating the need for you to
repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services,
and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.
</p>
<p>
We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications
such as welcome letters, information updates, billing information, information on technical service issues, and
security announcements. We may also contact you to inform you of other products or services available from Timus and
its Affiliates.
</p>
<p>
Personal information collected on the Website and through the Services may be stored and processed in the United
States or any other country in which Timus or its Affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by
using the Website or Services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
</p>
<p>
<b>Sharing of Information:</b> Timus will not sell, rent, or lease your information, including your personal
information,
to others. Timus shares personal information with its Affiliates and other companies working on our behalf. Except
as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own
marketing purposes unless you have provided consent.
</p>
<p>
Timus may share your information, including personal information, with its Affiliates. The information submitted
through Contact Forms may be stored and processed by Affiliates in the United States or any other country in which
the Affiliates maintain facilities, and by submitting a Contact Form, you consent to any such transfer of
information outside of your country.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, we use third parties to collect, use, analyze, and otherwise process information, including personal
information, on our behalf. This includes our use of certain products and services provided by third parties for the
purposes of enabling certain features on the Website, Management Portal, and Timus Connect. For example, if you
submit a Contact Form or otherwise provide information to us through the Website, the information you submit may be
processed by third-party providers that we use to enable Contact Forms and other interactions on the Website. We
occasionally hire other third parties to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and
delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing
statistical analysis of our services. For example, we may use a third-party payment processer to facilitate
purchases of subscriptions to use the Services. Service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal
information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information
and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
</p>
<p>
If you request something from the Website or through the Services (for example, a product or service, a callback, or
specific marketing materials), we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request or inquiry. To help
us do this, we may share information with our providers or Partners.
</p>
<p>
We may access or disclose your information, including your personal information, if we believe such action is
necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on Timus; (b) protect and defend the rights or
property of Timus (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the
personal safety of our customers or members of the public.
</p>
<p>

need to review them. Furthermore, whenever you transmit personal information, such as credit card information, to us

can come with different levels of encryption. See your browser’s settings or documentation for more information.
Finally, we take care to dispose of your information properly so that third parties will not be able to access it.
This includes destroying, erasing, or making unreadable the information. While we are committed to protecting your
privacy, please be aware that no transaction over the internet can be completely secure.

individuals who
reside in California. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended and supplemented by the California
Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively the “CCPA”) provides additional rights to know, delete and opt out, and
requires businesses collecting or disclosing Personal Information to provide notices and means to exercise rights.
For Purposes of this section, “Personal Information” has the definition set forth in the CCPA.
</p>
<p>

of information
enumerated in the CCPA in connection with the Websiteand Services:
</p>
<ul>
<li>First and last name, home, billing or other physical address (including street name, city/town,

<li>Any other information you have chosen to provide to us through the Website, Management Portal, or Timus
Connect.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We do not generally sell information as the term “sell” is traditionally understood. However, to the extent “sale”
under the CCPA would be interpreted to include any of the activities described in the “Sharing of information”
section above, we will comply with applicable law as to such activity.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Right to Know and Delete:</i></b> If you are a California resident, you have the right to delete Personal
Information we
have collected about you and you have the right to know certain information about our data practices. In particular,

</li>
<li>Business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the Personal Information; and</li>
<li>Specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you.</li>
</ul>

specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the request. We will confirm receipt of your
request within ten (10) days. We may require specific information from you to help us verify your identity and
process your request. Please note that, in many instances, we do not collect types of information that enable us to
identify you. As such, if we do not have information that permits us to verify your identity, we may deny your
requests to know or delete. A request for access can be made by you only twice within a twelve (12) month period.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Right to Opt Out:</i></b> Under the CCPA, you have the right to opt out of the sale of your Personal

</p>
<p>
<b><i>Authorized Agent:</i></b> You can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. However, we
will require
written proof of the agent’s permission to do so and verify your identity directly.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Right to Non-Discrimination:</i></b> You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the
exercise of
any your rights.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>California Do-Not-Track Notice:</i></b> We do not track our Website users over time and across third party

therefore do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
</p>
<p>
<b><u>NOTICE TO INTERNATIONAL RESIDENTS:</u></b> Timus is headquartered in the United States. The Website,
Management Portal, and
Timus Connect are primarily operated and managed on servers located and operated within the United States. In order
to use the Website or Services, you may be sending your personal information outside of the country where you reside
or are located, including to the United States. Accordingly, if you reside or are located outside of the United
States, your personal information may be transferred outside of the country where you reside or are located,
including to countries that may not or do not provide the same level of protection for your personal information. We
are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information when it is transferred.
</p>
<p>
<b><u>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR USERS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AND UNITED KINGDOM:</u></b> Timus is
established in the
United States and has operations and service providers in the United States and throughout the world. As such, we
and our service providers may transfer your personal information to, or access it in, jurisdictions that may not
provide levels of data protection equivalent to those in your country of residence. By using the Website or
Services, or otherwise interacting with us, regardless of where you live or where you provide information to us, you
consent to our use and our service providers’ use of your personal information worldwide and to the transfer of your
personal information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States. In certain
circumstances, courts, regulatory agencies, law enforcement agencies, or security authorities in those other
countries may be entitled to access your personal information.
</p>
<p>
Timus is aware of the July 16, 2020 ruling by the European Court of Justice invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield
Framework. Accordingly, we will take adequate measures designed to protect the transfer of Personal Information of
individuals in the European Economic Area (EU Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (“<b>EEA</b>”), such
as
relying on the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (“<b>EU SCCs</b>”) as a legal mechanism for
such
transfer, or other adequate transfer mechanism as required under relevant data protection laws, as well as
additional safeguards, where appropriate. A copy of these clauses may be obtained by contacting us at the email
address listed below.
</p>
<p>
For transfers to or from the United Kingdom (“<b>UK</b>”), we make use of the EU SCCs, as modified by the UK’s
International Data Transfer Addendum (collectively the “<b>UK SCCs</b>”). For individuals located in the EEA or the
UK, the
term “personal information,” as used in this section, is equivalent to “personal data” under applicable European and
UK data protection legislation.
</p>
<p>
If you are located in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, you have certain rights and protections under applicable law
regarding the processing of your personal information, as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation
(“<b>GDPR</b>”), and this section applies to you.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Legal Basis for Processing:</i></b> When we process your personal information, we will do so in reliance on
the following
lawful bases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., providing the services you requested).</li>
<li>When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal information to operate our business or protect
our interests (e.g., to provide, maintain, and improve our services, conduct data analytics, and communicate
with you).</li>
<li>To comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to maintain a record of your consents and track those who have
opted out of non-administrative communications).</li>
<li>When we have your consent to do so (e.g., when you opt in to receive non-administrative communications from
us). When consent is the legal basis for our processing your personal information, you may withdraw such consent
at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><i>Data Retention:</i></b> We store personal information associated with your account for as long as your account
remains
active. If you close your account, we will delete your account data within thirty (30) days, unless reasonably
necessary to comply with our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations. We store other data for as long as
necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally collected it and for other legitimate business purposes,
including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Your Rights:</i></b> For users in the European Union, according to the GDPR, you have the following statutory
rights:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Information.</b> At the point where personal information is collected from the data subject, as defined by
the GDPR,
or obtained from another source, there is a requirement to inform the data subject about our use of that
personal
information and the rights of data subjects over it. Compliance with this right is provided within this Privacy
Policy.</li>
<li><b>Access.</b> You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal information concerning
you is
being processed, and, where that is the case, all necessary information to make the process transparent. You
also
have the right to obtain a copy of your personal information being processed.</li>
<li><b>Rectification.</b> You have the right to require rectification of inaccurate data about you.</li>
<li><b>Erasure.</b> You have the right to ask for the deletion of your data in certain circumstances.</li>
<li><b>Restrict processing.</b> You have the right to restrict processing of data under certain specified
circumstances.
</li>
<li><b>Data portability.</b> You have the right to request for the receipt or the transfer to another organization,
in a
machine-readable form, of your personal information.</li>
<li><b>Object to processing.</b> You have the right to ask us to stop using all or some of your personal information
under
certain specified circumstances.</li>
<li><b>Right to withdraw consent.</b> When you have given your explicit consent for the processing of your data, you
can
withdraw it at any time without justification. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of
processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If would like to exercise your rights, please let us know by sending an email at <a href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;86eae3e1e7eac6f2efebf3f5e8e3f2f1e9f4edf5a8e5e9eb&quot;>[email&amp;#160;protected]</a>.
</p>
<p>
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority or to the Data Protection
Authority where the alleged infringement took place.

as
described below in this section of the Privacy Policy. We may also collect certain information automatically as you
use the Website or Services. Please review the section further below in this Privacy Policy titled “Cookies and
Tracking Technologies” for more information on our automatic collection practices.

</p>
<p>
<b>How We Use Your Information:</b> Timus collects and uses your information, including your personal information,
to
operate and improve the Website, Management Platform, and Timus Connect, and to deliver the services or carry out
the transactions you have requested. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service;
making the Website, Management Platform, and Timus Connect easier to use by eliminating the need for you to
repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services,
and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.
</p>
<p>
We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications
such as welcome letters, information updates, billing information, information on technical service issues, and
security announcements. We may also contact you to inform you of other products or services available from Timus and
its Affiliates.
</p>
<p>
Personal information collected on the Website and through the Services may be stored and processed in the United
States or any other country in which Timus or its Affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by
using the Website or Services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
</p>
<p>
<b>Sharing of Information:</b> Timus will not sell, rent, or lease your information, including your personal
information,
to others. Timus shares personal information with its Affiliates and other companies working on our behalf. Except
as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own
marketing purposes unless you have provided consent.
</p>
<p>
Timus may share your information, including personal information, with its Affiliates. The information submitted
through Contact Forms may be stored and processed by Affiliates in the United States or any other country in which
the Affiliates maintain facilities, and by submitting a Contact Form, you consent to any such transfer of
information outside of your country.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, we use third parties to collect, use, analyze, and otherwise process information, including personal
information, on our behalf. This includes our use of certain products and services provided by third parties for the
purposes of enabling certain features on the Website, Management Portal, and Timus Connect. For example, if you
submit a Contact Form or otherwise provide information to us through the Website, the information you submit may be
processed by third-party providers that we use to enable Contact Forms and other interactions on the Website. We
occasionally hire other third parties to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and
delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing
statistical analysis of our services. For example, we may use a third-party payment processer to facilitate
purchases of subscriptions to use the Services. Service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal
information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information
and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
</p>
<p>
If you request something from the Website or through the Services (for example, a product or service, a callback, or
specific marketing materials), we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request or inquiry. To help
us do this, we may share information with our providers or Partners.
</p>
<p>
We may access or disclose your information, including your personal information, if we believe such action is
necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on Timus; (b) protect and defend the rights or
property of Timus (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the
personal safety of our customers or members of the public.
</p>

<b><u>SPECIFIC PROVISIONS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS:</u></b> This section of the Privacy Policy applies only to
individuals who
reside in California. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended and supplemented by the California
Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively the “CCPA”) provides additional rights to know, delete and opt out, and
requires businesses collecting or disclosing Personal Information to provide notices and means to exercise rights.
For Purposes of this section, “Personal Information” has the definition set forth in the CCPA.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>California Notice of Collection:</i></b> We or our service providers have collected the following categories
of information
enumerated in the CCPA in connection with the Websiteand Services:
</p>
<ul>
<li>First and last name, home, billing or other physical address (including street name, city/town,

<li>Any other information you have chosen to provide to us through the Website, Management Portal, or Timus
Connect.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We do not generally sell information as the term “sell” is traditionally understood. However, to the extent “sale”
under the CCPA would be interpreted to include any of the activities described in the “Sharing of information”
section above, we will comply with applicable law as to such activity.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Right to Know and Delete:</i></b> If you are a California resident, you have the right to delete Personal
Information we

</li>
<li>Business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the Personal Information; and</li>
<li>Specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To exercise any of these rights, please submit a request to us at <a href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;eb878e8c8a87ab9f82869e98858e9f9c84998098c5888486&quot;>[email&amp;#160;protected]</a>. In the request, please
specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the request. We will confirm receipt of your
request within ten (10) days. We may require specific information from you to help us verify your identity and
process your request. Please note that, in many instances, we do not collect types of information that enable us to
identify you. As such, if we do not have information that permits us to verify your identity, we may deny your
requests to know or delete. A request for access can be made by you only twice within a twelve (12) month period.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Right to Opt Out:</i></b> Under the CCPA, you have the right to opt out of the sale of your Personal
Information to third
parties at any time. Timus does not “sell” your Personal Information as it is currently defined under the CCPA. You

<b><u>NOTICE TO INTERNATIONAL RESIDENTS:</u></b> Timus is headquartered in the United States. The Website,
Management Portal, and
Timus Connect are primarily operated and managed on servers located and operated within the United States. In order
to use the Website or Services, you may be sending your personal information outside of the country where you reside
or are located, including to the United States. Accordingly, if you reside or are located outside of the United
States, your personal information may be transferred outside of the country where you reside or are located,
including to countries that may not or do not provide the same level of protection for your personal information. We
are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information when it is transferred.
</p>
<p>
<b><u>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR USERS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AND UNITED KINGDOM:</u></b> Timus is
established in the
United States and has operations and service providers in the United States and throughout the world. As such, we
and our service providers may transfer your personal information to, or access it in, jurisdictions that may not
provide levels of data protection equivalent to those in your country of residence. By using the Website or
Services, or otherwise interacting with us, regardless of where you live or where you provide information to us, you
consent to our use and our service providers’ use of your personal information worldwide and to the transfer of your
personal information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States. In certain
circumstances, courts, regulatory agencies, law enforcement agencies, or security authorities in those other
countries may be entitled to access your personal information.
</p>
<p>
Timus is aware of the July 16, 2020 ruling by the European Court of Justice invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield
Framework. Accordingly, we will take adequate measures designed to protect the transfer of Personal Information of
individuals in the European Economic Area (EU Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (“<b>EEA</b>”), such
as
relying on the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (“<b>EU SCCs</b>”) as a legal mechanism for
such
transfer, or other adequate transfer mechanism as required under relevant data protection laws, as well as
additional safeguards, where appropriate. A copy of these clauses may be obtained by contacting us at the email
address listed below.
</p>
<p>
For transfers to or from the United Kingdom (“<b>UK</b>”), we make use of the EU SCCs, as modified by the UK’s
International Data Transfer Addendum (collectively the “<b>UK SCCs</b>”). For individuals located in the EEA or the
UK, the
term “personal information,” as used in this section, is equivalent to “personal data” under applicable European and
UK data protection legislation.
</p>
<p>
If you are located in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, you have certain rights and protections under applicable law
regarding the processing of your personal information, as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation
(“<b>GDPR</b>”), and this section applies to you.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Legal Basis for Processing:</i></b> When we process your personal information, we will do so in reliance on
the following
lawful bases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., providing the services you requested).</li>
<li>When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal information to operate our business or protect
our interests (e.g., to provide, maintain, and improve our services, conduct data analytics, and communicate
with you).</li>
<li>To comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to maintain a record of your consents and track those who have
opted out of non-administrative communications).</li>
<li>When we have your consent to do so (e.g., when you opt in to receive non-administrative communications from
us). When consent is the legal basis for our processing your personal information, you may withdraw such consent
at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><i>Data Retention:</i></b> We store personal information associated with your account for as long as your account
remains
active. If you close your account, we will delete your account data within thirty (30) days, unless reasonably
necessary to comply with our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations. We store other data for as long as
necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally collected it and for other legitimate business purposes,
including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Your Rights:</i></b> For users in the European Union, according to the GDPR, you have the following statutory
rights:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Information.</b> At the point where personal information is collected from the data subject, as defined by
the GDPR,
or obtained from another source, there is a requirement to inform the data subject about our use of that
personal
information and the rights of data subjects over it. Compliance with this right is provided within this Privacy
Policy.</li>
<li><b>Access.</b> You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal information concerning
you is
being processed, and, where that is the case, all necessary information to make the process transparent. You
also
have the right to obtain a copy of your personal information being processed.</li>
<li><b>Rectification.</b> You have the right to require rectification of inaccurate data about you.</li>
<li><b>Erasure.</b> You have the right to ask for the deletion of your data in certain circumstances.</li>
<li><b>Restrict processing.</b> You have the right to restrict processing of data under certain specified
circumstances.
</li>
<li><b>Data portability.</b> You have the right to request for the receipt or the transfer to another organization,
in a
machine-readable form, of your personal information.</li>
<li><b>Object to processing.</b> You have the right to ask us to stop using all or some of your personal information
under
certain specified circumstances.</li>
<li><b>Right to withdraw consent.</b> When you have given your explicit consent for the processing of your data, you
can
withdraw it at any time without justification. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of
processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If would like to exercise your rights, please let us know by sending an email at <a href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e68a8381878aa6928f8b93958883929189948d95c885898b&quot;>[email&amp;#160;protected]</a>.
</p>
<p>
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority or to the Data Protection
Authority where the alleged infringement took place.
